Now you can since you can now be notified for every post this person makes. Simply click the bell icon in the user profile and you’ll be notified. Right now there’s no API for that notification type so you won’t receive push notifications from the koyu.space app regarding these notifications.</p><h1 id=bunny-ears>Bunny ears</h1><p>Everyone now has bunny ears around their avatar. We think that’s fun. Just check it out.</p><h1 id=new-theme-pumpkin>New theme: Pumpkin</h1><p>We got a new theme, the “Pumpkin” theme for Halloween (which is over now).
