The server that manages connectivity for the production machine had intermittent connectivity issues (i.e. pinging 8.8.8.8 would fail, even pinging the hosting providers gateway would also fail).</p><p>A ticket was opened with the hosting provider on the 22nd.</p><p>Repeated attempts to get a response was met finally with</p><p>“For the root cause we isolated the problem to a rogue device that was failing and was causing a routing loop within the network. “</p><p>Which was very very concerning since it appears only our instance was affected.</p><p>So I thought “ok great, we’ll see if it goes down again”. Of course, I woke up to 60 notifications of things going down. I sent 3 follow ups with 1-2 hours inbetween to the provider and was ignored.</p><p>The hosting provider has now been ditched, and a new provider is used for the routing setup as of 30 minutes ago.</p><p>Apologies for the severe instability from the bottom of my heart, I promise to be more proactive in future.</p><p>Automatic downtime alerts are posted to the Telegram channel at <a href=https://t.me/koyuspace>https://t.me/koyuspace</a></p><h1 id=yubikey-support>Yubikey support</h1><p>koyu.space got support for Yubikeys and other hardware security keys. Securing admin accounts through hardware 2fa makes it even harder from an outside-attacker to gain access to koyu.space’s internal infrastructure. We think this is a crucial step to make koyu.space even more secure and fun to use.</p><h1 id=general-database-fixes>General database fixes</h1><p>The database was being moved to faster storage to finally resolve some long-standing performance issues, along with a DoS bug we had found.</p><h1 id=trending-hashtags>Trending hashtags</h1><p>Trending hashtags are now updating and have been re-enabled again, thanks to <a href=https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/13450#issuecomment-684627501 target=_blank>this friendly guy on GitHub</a>.</p><h1 id=offtopic>Offtopic</h1><p>To celebrate way better speed and stability of koyu.space koyu and arduino101 had a little party.
