koyu.space has been running in maintenance-mode for almost a year now. This is fine, because koyu.space itself as a project is finalized. This means while I accept changes from outside collaborators like Mastodon or glitch-soc me myself won't add or fix any features. This also brings into question what will happen with koyu.space itself. Let me elaborate my roadmap I have planned for 2022:

- Running koyu.space like normal, it won't go away or anywhere
- Investing into VR hardware and planning to build my first VR game/demo with a few koyu.space members
- Actually doing the VR project the whole time then and integrate some koyu.space functionality in the project for convenience

I hope this clears up some things and I hope you understand what I have planned. As always, drop me a DM or send me an e-mail.

Leonie ❤️
