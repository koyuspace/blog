The development work is now over for September and October 2020 and we are ready to present everything that happened around koyu.space to you. A lot of things happened and we donâ€™t want you to miss out on all these important changes.

# Fix image uploads

We finally fixed broken images showing up everywhere on koyu.space and we hope you&#8217;ll like [this change][1].

# Post notifications

Wanted to know when the least active person in your feed posted something after a while? Now you can since you can now be notified for every post this person makes. Simply click the bell icon in the user profile and you&#8217;ll be notified. Right now there&#8217;s no API for that notification type so you won&#8217;t receive push notifications from the koyu.space app regarding these notifications.

# Bunny ears

Everyone now has bunny ears around their avatar. We think that&#8217;s fun. Just check it out.

# New theme: Pumpkin

We got a new theme, the &#8220;Pumpkin&#8221; theme for Halloween (which is over now). This orange/black combo looks really nice.

# Picture-in-Picture mode for desktop

Now you can watch videos or listen to music while you scroll through the timeline at once! Welcome to the 21st century.

# We moved from Liberapay to Creapaid

Creapaid is a payment platform for recurring donations made by [stux][2] which takes way less fees than Liberapay, looks nicer and also allows us to better find out who donated so we can give away the perks you&#8217;d get if you donate. If you want to donate once you can still do that on the [koyu.space Shop][3].

# Announcing koyu.space Chat

[koyu.space Chat][4] is now our preffered chat platform. It&#8217;s being bridged to our [Telegram group][5], IRC and [Discord server][6].

# Smaller changes

We also had a few smaller changes:

  * Re-enabled back button in user settings
  * Fix a hell lot of awful crashes
  * Chromium scrollbars should look a lot nicer now
  * Redesigned login page
  * Fixes for the &#8220;unread notifications&#8221; marker
  * More German
  * More bunnies
  * and more fun!

# Offtopic

Nothing here. Check back later.
